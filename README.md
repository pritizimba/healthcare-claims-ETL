# Healthcare Claims ETL & PMPM Analytics Project

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end ETL pipeline** for synthetic **US healthcare claims**, **member eligibility**, and **provider** datasets.  
It includes **data ingestion, validation, standardization, transformation, member-month calculations, PMPM analytics, and documentation** — similar to what is done in payer, actuarial, and healthcare analytics roles.

✅ Built for showcasing skills in **US healthcare data**  
✅ Uses **synthetic, HIPAA-safe** data  
✅ Includes **Python ETL scripts** and **data validation**  
✅ Generates **PMPM (Per Member Per Month)** and **utilization metrics**  
✅ Fully version-controlled with Git
